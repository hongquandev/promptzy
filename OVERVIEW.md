## üîÑ Data Flow

1. **Local Storage**: Prompts are stored in the browser's localStorage
   - Uses key-value pairs for prompts and tags
   - Automatically extracts and stores unique tags
2. **Supabase Storage**: Cloud storage option for persistence across devices
   - Custom table schema for prompts with additional metadata
   - User authentication for multi-user support
3. **Dual Mode**: Can synchronize between local and cloud storage
   - Fallback to local storage if cloud storage fails
   - Option to use both simultaneously

## üíª Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`, `bun install`, or `yarn install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`, `bun run dev`, or `yarn dev`
4. Access the application at http://localhost:8080

## üîí Authentication

The application uses Supabase authentication for cloud storage features. Users can:
- Create an account or log in to access cloud storage
- Use the application without authentication for local-only storage
- Configure custom Supabase credentials in the settings

## üß† AI Assistant

The application includes an AI Assistant feature that:
- Helps users generate new prompt ideas
- Supports both system and task prompt generation
- Uses the Pollinations.ai API with streaming responses
- Allows customization of the system prompt used for generation

## üîÆ Recent Improvements

- Enhanced UI with improved styling and responsive design
- AI Assistant with streaming response support
- Prompt type categorization (system/task)
- Customizable system prompt for AI generation
- Improved Supabase integration with fallback mechanisms

## üöß Future Development

- Prompt version history
- AI prompt templates
- Shared prompt libraries
- Additional storage backends
- Advanced tagging with hierarchies
- Team collaboration features
