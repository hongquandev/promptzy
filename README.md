### Quick Start (Global Installation)

Install globally from npm and run with a single command:

npm install -g @pinkpixel/promptzy

# Run Promptzy
promptzy
```

Promptzy will start on `http://localhost:4173` and open automatically in your browser!

**Alternative commands:**
```bash
# Legacy commands still work
prompt-dashboard
ai-prompt-dashboard

# Or run directly with npx (no installation needed)
npx @pinkpixel/promptzy
```

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pinkpixel-dev/promptzy.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd promptzy

# Install dependencies (choose one)
npm install
# or
bun install
# or
yarn install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
# or
bun run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### üì± Mobile App Installation (PWA)

Promptzy can be installed as a mobile app directly from your browser! No app store needed.

**On Mobile (iOS/Android):**
1. Visit the Promptzy website in your mobile browser
2. Look for "Add to Home Screen" or "Install App" popup
3. Tap "Install" or "Add"
4. Promptzy will appear on your home screen like a native app!

**On Desktop (Chrome/Edge):**
1. Visit the website
2. Look for the install icon in the address bar
3. Click to install as a desktop app

**Benefits of the Mobile App:**
- üì± Native app experience with no browser UI
- ‚ö° Faster loading and offline functionality
- üîÑ Automatic updates when new versions are released
- üè† Easy access from your home screen
- üîÑ Manual refresh button for syncing prompts after setup

### Deployment

For deploying to Cloudflare Pages or other platforms, see the [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) guide.

## üîß Configuration

### Local Storage

By default, the application uses browser localStorage - no configuration needed!

### Supabase Configuration

To use cloud storage features:

1. Create a Supabase account and project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Configure your Supabase credentials:

   - Open Promptzy
   - Go to Settings (gear icon)
   - Select "Supabase" as your storage option
   - Enter your Supabase Project URL and API Key
     - Find these in your Supabase dashboard under Project Settings ‚Üí API
   - Click "Connect" to verify your credentials
3. Create the required database table:

   - After connecting, you'll need to set up the prompts table manually
   - Click the "Open SQL Editor" button in the settings
   - Copy the SQL code provided in the settings (or use the SQL from `supabase-setup.sql`)
   - Paste and run it in the Supabase SQL Editor
4. Return to Promptzy and click "Connect" again to verify the table setup
5. Save your settings
6. Use the "Refresh" button in the header to load your prompts

   **Note:** Automatic table creation isn't supported by Supabase for security reasons, so this one-time manual setup is required. After setup, use the refresh button to ensure prompts load properly, especially on mobile devices.

The application will now use your Supabase instance for cloud storage!

#### Synchronization Details

When using the "Both" storage option:

- New prompts are saved to both local storage and Supabase
- When you open the application, it will:
  1. Load local prompts first
  2. Fetch prompts from Supabase
  3. Merge them, preferring Supabase versions for duplicate IDs
  4. Sync any unique local prompts to Supabase
  5. Save any unique Supabase prompts to local storage

This bidirectional sync ensures your prompts are available across devices and you always have a local backup.

> **Note:** Cloud sync requires opening the application with the same Supabase configuration on all devices. Your storage preference is saved in your browser's localStorage.

## üìñ Usage

1. Launch the application
2. Configure your Supabase connection in Settings
3. Use the "Refresh" button to load your prompts after setup
4. Add prompts with the "+" button
5. Assign tags to organize your prompts
6. Use the search box and tag filters to find prompts
7. Select a prompt to copy it or edit its details
